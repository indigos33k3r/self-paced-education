### Getting Started with Python

Note that we use Python 2 in this class, not Python 3. For more on why Python 2 is still more popular than the newer version, [see this document](http://blog.startifact.com/posts/python-2-gravity.html).

For installation instructions, click [this](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Open a terminal and type the following:

    $ python

This will start the Python interpreter, where you can execute Python code on the fly. You should see something like this after hitting the Enter key:

    Python 2.7.5 (default, Mar  9 2014, 22:15:05) 
    [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 5.0 (clang-500.0.68)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 
    
At the prompt, type this:

    >>> print 3
    
And you should see this output:

    3
    
Try out some other things:

    >>> print "Hello"
    Hello
    >>> print 3 + 3
    6
    >>> print True
    True
    
Python can be used for arithmetic very elegantly:

    >>> print (3 * 3) + 4 + (9 / 3)
    16
    
Sometimes, you want to write things down in a program, but don't want the computer to try and run them. That's what *comments* are for:

    # This line will be ignored
    print 2 + 2 # This comment is next to code that will be executed
    
    """
    This is a multiline string.
    It can be used for commenting as well.
    Don't forget to close it when done.
    """

Continue to play around with the Python interpreter!
