#Courses

**Notes and solutions from various courses**

*by Ty-Lucas Kelley*

###Background

There are tons of great, free, and online courses out there. In fact, there are so many that I will never be able to enjoy taking all of them. That's what inspired me to create this repository of course notes and solutions; while simple notes will never be a full replacement for a course experience, they can at least be a substitute that take much less time to go through.

I write very detailed notes and solutions for every class I take. I'm sharing them here with the hopes that others will:

1. Benefit from them and share them with others.
2. Be inspired to share their own notes and solutions.
3. Offer feedback and criticism, so I can improve my note-taking.

Despite this being public and on GitHub, I will not accept any pull requests. This is meant to be a repository of my notes and solutions, not a community-driven effort like Victor Felder's [Free Programming Books](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books). I would encourage those who wish to contribute to create and share their own notes and solutions.

I will also mention that my notes are not always an exact representation of what was taught in the class. I sometimes remove what I feel is unnecessary and add what I feel is supplementary or helpful.

Enjoy!

###Topics Covered

The focus will be on computer science, math, and engineering-related courses, but I have other interests as well, like music and history.

Below is a list of everything that I have planned / completed. There may be notes and solutions that are present in the repository but are still incomplete, so read this list to see what I feel is "production-ready".
